- 👋 Hi, My name is Kefan Cao
- 👀 I’m currently studying Computer Science + Statistics at the University of Waterloo
- 🌱 I am extremely interested in probability theory related questions, so if you have any you'd like to share, please reach out at kefancao@outlook.com!
- 🎲 Check out my puzzles repo for some problems I find interesting!
- 🧮 I also have some repos focused on numerical methods. There usually is a demonstration involved with them and I find them really cool!
